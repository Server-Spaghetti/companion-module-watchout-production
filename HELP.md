The Parameter when loading a Show with "Load Show" is different when controlling a production computer or a display cluster.
When loading a show on a prodruction computer use the path to the show file and if needed with forward slashes, eg: C:/mygreatestshows/nicetry.watch
When loading a show on a display cluster only use the name of the show file (even without .watch), eg: nicetry
You have to distribute the show to the display computers before and you must only use basic ASCII characters in show and path names.
